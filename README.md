# UofT-CourseSync

## Project Overview

**UofT-CourseSync** is a website designed to assist students at the University of Toronto in managing their coursework. The platform serves multiple purposes:

### Course Management

- Students can create accounts on the website.
- Once logged in, they can add the courses they are enrolled in.
- The website securely stores this information, allowing students to access it anytime.

### Assignment and Test Tracking

- The website extracts information from course syllabi, such as assignments, tests, and their due dates.
- This information is displayed on the website, and students can also have it automatically added to their personal calendars (such as Google Calendar).

### Grade Calculation

- The website extracts the weight of each assignment and test from the syllabus.
- Students can enter the scores they received on each assignment and test.
- Based on the entered scores and the weight of each component, the website calculates the studentâ€™s current grade in the course.
